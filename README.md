# ConFREE: Conflict-free Client Update Aggregation for Personalized Federated Learning

This README provides guidance on how to set up, run, and extend the code associated with our method, which is designed to be integrated within the PFLlib framework. Our approach is orthogonal to the existing methods in PFLlib, making it possible to combine them for complementary performance gains. The execution environment and dependencies are identical to those of PFLlib to ensure seamless integration.
